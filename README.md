# FENCE #
## An NES game for 2017+ by some crazy person! ##

### Compiling ###

I've provided a build.bat / build.command that shows how to compile this using CC65. I'm using CC65 version 2.16 (it matters).

### Running ###

Compile and put the .nes file into any standard NES emulator. I'm debugging using FCEUX and testing using Nestopia. They all have their quirks.

### How to play ###
